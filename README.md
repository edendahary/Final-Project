_Project Description_
----------------------------------------
Intended for computer science students who want to practice algorithm problems, this is a networking web site that allows students to study, test themselves and track their progress. 
Our product allows lecturers to monitor students’ grades and progress. 

Projected benefits for the consumer - the student receives feedback when he submits a solution to the programming algorithm.

Projected benefits for the lecturer – the lecturer receives the student’s score when the student submits a solution.
